                I am a Software Developer with experience in full stack development, specializing in creating web and mobile applications. I approach each project with dedication and attention to detail, aiming to deliver functional and well-structured solutions tailored to the specific needs of users and clients.
                I have contributed to projects such as Heritour, a platform for monitoring cultural heritage and promoting tourism, developed using React Remix and SpringBoot, and Foodlovery, an ecosystem of mobile and web applications built with 
                <strong>Ionic/Angular</strong>, 
                <strong>NestJS</strong>, and 
                <strong>Angular</strong>. 
                I worked on Vdesk, a tool for managing recurring tasks, using Angular and Laravel, and collaborated with 
                <strong>TeamSystem</strong> to enhance workforce management systems implemented in C and C++. I enjoy working in teams, sharing ideas, and learning from every experience to grow professionally and continually improve my skills.
